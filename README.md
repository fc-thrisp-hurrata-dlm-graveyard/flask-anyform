flask-anyform
----

Render context aware forms anywhere in your application through a configurable interface.

Created as natural progression on work done with [flask-security inline_forms branch](https://github.com/thrisp/flask-security)
 & [flack](https://github.com/thrisp/flack), this extension abstracts common
form integration functionality away from specific implementations for all flask
applications.

Note: this is not a form creation library, or a shortcut to form creation, just
a tool for in-app management of forms
