flask-anyform

Render context aware forms anywhere in application. 

Provides an interface to forms for flask applications.

Created as natural progression on work done with (flask-security)[https://github.com/thrisp/flask-security]
inline_forms branch & (flack)[https://github.com/thrisp/flack], this extension abstracts common
functionality away from specific implementations for all flask applications
